# Selction-Sort
Overview:

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.

Steps of Selection Sort:

*Initialize:

-Start with the first element of the array as the current minimum.

*Iterate Through the Array:

-For each position in the array, find the minimum element in the unsorted portion.

*Swap Elements:

-Swap the minimum element found with the element at the current position.

*Repeat:

-Continue this process for the entire array until it is sorted.
